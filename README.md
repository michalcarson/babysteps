# Baby Steps 
## Refactoring Page-Oriented PHP

This project is a presentation for the OKC PHP user group. The intention is to
 show how to move from a page-oriented coding style into a more professional, 
 object-oriented and framework-based system.
 
Each commit within the project shows the progress toward this goal. Begin by
examining the initial commit and move forward.

Just to be clear, there are no guarantees that this code will actually run. :D
